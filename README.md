# uniFrontend (Work In Progress)

## About
This is a project for future references and is being coded as part of a uni class called "Web Engineering II". It is a React application with Redux for state management and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for design. It is the pendant to my other project [uniBackend](https://github.com/Kyobancha/uniBackend) which uses a Node environment with MongoDB (with Mongoose) and Express. The project is estimated to be finished in mid July 2022.

## How to run this project
To run this project, move into the project's root directory using your console and enter ```npm install```, followed by ```npm start```. In case you would like to provide your own config file, you can replace the purposely pre-shipped config-file using [react-global-configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-global-configuration). Otherwise this project runs on http://localhost:3000/ using the pre-shipped config-file.

## Current Progress

Login works. If you are using my other project [uniBackend](https://github.com/Kyobancha/uniBackend) as backend, you should be able to login using the default-login:
