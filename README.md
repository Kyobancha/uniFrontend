# uniFrontend (premature WIP)

## About
This is a project for future references and is being coded as part of a uni class called "Web Engineering II". It is a React application with Redux for state management and tailwindcss for design. It is the pendant to my other project (uniBackend)[https://github.com/Kyobancha/uniBackend] which uses MongoDB (with Mongoose) and Express. This project is in a very premature state. Therefore the styling won't be very convincing, just as the React code. Also Redux has not been included into the project yet. This will follow in the future though. The project is estimated to be finished in mid July 2022.

## How to run this project
To run this project, move into the project's root directory using your console and enter ```npm install```, followed by ```npm start```.
